				As you can see, we’ve had a chance to take the best of Uncharted—the set pieces, the puzzles,<br> 
				cinematic storytelling, and exotic locales—and tell a completely new story with Chloe Frazer at <br>the helm. She’s on the hunt for the legendary golden Tusk of Ganesh forged by the ancient <br>Hoysala Empire, and to find it, she enlists the help of Nadine Ross. However, if there’s anything <br>we know about Chloe and Nadine, it’s that they both keep things close to the vest. Over the <br>course of the story, we’ll explore Chloe and Nadine’s struggle to trust one another. <br>But they aren’t the only ones searching for the Tusk. The story trailer also introduces our new <br>antagonist: Asav. He’s a calm, calculating, and ruthless warmonger that is waging a civil war in <br>the region. To keep it from falling into Asav’s hands, Chloe and Nadine will travel from war-torn

				Beginning with Uncharted 3, we’ve worked closely with ESC-Toy and Erick Scarecrow to create <br>amazing collectibles from the Uncharted universe and The Last of Us. From high-quality pin and <br>limited edition vinyl figures, Erick and ESC-Toy have brought a distinctive stylized approach to <br> our characters. Now, inspired by Uncharted 4, ESC-Toy has returned to release a new Nathan <br>Drake figure. On top of the signature ESC-Toy design, the Uncharted 4 Nathan Drake now has 15  <br>points of articulation and a removable grappling hook.
				<br>
				<br>
				There are three colorways and two of them are extremely limited. The unique red and black <br>Naughty Dog colorway is back, and only 250 pieces of that will be released. If you’re looking for <br>something even more unique, there’s a bundle pack that includes the regular colorway, the <br> Naughty dog colorway, an all gold colorway, and a brand new Nathan Drake pin that matches the <br>style of the figures. The full set is limited to only 100 bundles!  <br><br>Pre-ordering any of the three versions will also get you a yet to be revealed, but exclusive <br>Uncharted 4 Multiplayer DLC character customization item. <br> <br>The limited edition Uncharted 4 Nathan Drake figures are now available for pre-order on <br>
